# (Baby) Zerocash over Ethereum

We've changed Parity to support a snark precompile: https://github.com/gancherj/parity/commit/b820abf755e216ccf24640549735412ec02dac62

We've created an Ethereum contract: `zoe/contract/`

We've implemented a primitive mixing circuit: https://github.com/ebfull/hackishlibsnarkbindings and bindings to libsnark for SNARK verification in Rust.
